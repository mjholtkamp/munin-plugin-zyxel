Graph bandwidth usage and line speed of ZyXEL P-2812HNU modems.

For Licensing, see LICENSE file.

==============================================================
Usage:
- Copy the 'zyxel_' file to /usr/local/munin/plugins.
- Copy the files from the 'sbin' directory to /usr/local/sbin.
- Make symlinks to specific interfaces you want to graph
Examples: 
  /etc/munin/plugins/zyxel_br0 -> /usr/local/munin/plugins/zyxel_
  /etc/munin/plugins/zyxel_ptm0 -> /usr/local/munin/plugins/zyxel_
  /etc/munin/plugins/zyxel_vdsl -> /usr/local/munin/plugins/zyxel_

The modem needs to have TELNET enabled (not SSH). I'm aware
that telnet is not secure as the password go over the line
in the clear, but on the other hand, if you configure your
modem with http (as this modem does), the password goes in
the clear anyway.

Which username/password? The same one as you use when you
login into the website. By default, this is admin/1234
I hope you changed that!

How to configure the username and password? Use munin's
configuration method: create a file in /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d
(for example: local-zyxel) and put the following contents
in that file:

----8<---cut here----8<-----
[zyxel_*]
env.modem_username admin
env.modem_password 1234
env.modem_hostname 192.168.1.254
----8<---cut here----8<-----

Obviously, fill in the values for the password and hostname
(I've used the defaults).

The reload the munin-node service (service munin-node restart).
You can test if the script gives output by issuing the following
commands:

  munin-run zyxel_ptm0
  munin-run zyxel_vdsl

(Of course, run only for the symlinks that you created).

This munin plugin expects two scripts in /usr/local/sbin:
1) /usr/local/sbin/zyxel_if_acct.sh: an except script, uses
   telnet to get the accounting info on the interfaces. Used
   for the interfaces.
2) /usr/local/sbin/zyxel_diagnostics.py: a python script,
   used to simulate a browser to get the DSL Line Speed
   information.

If you do not like to put the scripts in /usr/local/sbin,
edit the variables in the zyxel_ munin script.
